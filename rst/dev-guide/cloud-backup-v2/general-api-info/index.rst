General API Information
-----------------------

The Rackspace Cloud Backup API is implemented using a RESTful web service interface. Like other products in the Rackspace Cloud suite, Rackspace Cloud Backup shares a common token-based authentication system that allows seamless access between products and services.

..  note::
    All requests to authenticate against and operate the service are performed using SSL over HTTP (HTTPS) on TCP port 443.
